	"Description": "Xherdan Shaqiri scored an exquisite overhead kick as Liverpool thrashed Manchester United 4-1 in the International Champions Cup in front of 101,254 fans in Ann Arbor.",
	"Main_content": "Jose Mourinho named a starting XI including five players who did not feature in the Premier League for United last season, while Liverpool fielded a strong side featuring Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Jurgen Klopp's team took the lead on 26 minutes when Mane stroked home from the penalty spot after Salah was brought down by Demetri Mitchell. But their advantage did not last long as United levelled through Andreas Pereira's superb free-kick from 25 yards. Liverpool substitute Daniel Sturridge continued his impressive pre-season form when he scored with his first touch after 66 minutes before Sheyi Ojo added his side's second spot-kick of the game six minutes later.",
